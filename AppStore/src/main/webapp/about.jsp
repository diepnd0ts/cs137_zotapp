            <h2><b>ZotApp was founded in rebellious spirits with a simple goal in mind: to make the search for the best mobile applications easier.</b></h2>
            <h2>Every good idea starts with a problem. In today's time, looking for a good game to play during your downtime is becoming more and more
                difficult. With the saturation of the app store and lack of filtering, it's becoming more of a struggle to find the right app for you. 
                Our problem is simple: it takes too much time to find a good game. The rest of us noticed similar problems. The reviews and ratings of
                the apps weren't a good indicator for what were the best games in the market. How are we supposed to pick a game to play when the filtering
                system doesn't work as intended? </h2>
            <h2>We started ZotApp as an alternative.</h2>
            <h2>By testing each and every game ourselves and ignoring the Android and Apple rating system, we're able to curate the best games in the market to save you the time of searching. </h2>
            <h2>We believe that the best apps aren't the ones that you personally find, but the ones that friends recommend to you.</h2>
            <h2>We also believe that your time should be spent in the game rather than browsing an appstore.</h2>
            <h2>So here we are, a friend to a friend, happy gaming.</h2>
